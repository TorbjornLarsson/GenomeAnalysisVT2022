NAME AND VERSION:
PhyloPhlAn version 0.99 (8 May 2013)

AUTHORS:
Nicola Segata (nsegata@hsph.harvard.edu) and Curtis Huttenhower (chuttenh@hsph.harvard.edu)

DESCRIPTION
PhyloPhlAn is a computational pipeline for reconstructing highly accurate and resolved 
phylogenetic trees based on whole-genome sequence information. The pipeline is scalable 
to thousands of genomes and uses the most conserved 400 proteins for extracting the 
phylogenetic signal.
PhyloPhlAn also implements taxonomic curation, estimation, and insertion operations.

positional arguments:
  PROJECT NAME          The basename of the project corresponding to the name of the input data folder inside 
                        input/. The input data consist of a collection of multifasta files (extension .faa)
                        containing the proteins in each genome. 
                        If the project already exists, the already executed steps are not re-ran.
                        The results will be stored in a folder with the project basename in output/
                        Multiple project can be generated and they safetely coexists.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --integrate       Integrate user genomes into the PhyloPhlAn tree 
  -u, --user_tree       Build a phylogenetic tree using user genomes only 
  -t, --taxonomic_analysis
                        Check taxonomic inconsistencies and refine/correct taxonomic labels
  --tax_test TAX_TEST   nerrors:type:taxl:tmin:tex:name (alpha version, experimental!)
  -c, --clean           Clean the final and partial data produced for the specified project.
                         (use --cleanall for removing general installation and database files)
  --cleanall            Remove all instalation and database file leaving untouched the initial compressed data 
                        that is automatically extracted and formatted at the first pipeline run.
                        Projects are not remove (specify a project and use -c for removing projects).
  --nproc N             The number of CPUs to use for parallelizing the blasting
                        [default 1, i.e. no parallelism]
  -v, --version         Prints the current PhyloPhlAn version and exit
